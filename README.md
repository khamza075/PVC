# CarGHG (previously PVC)
A software for assessing the efficacy of various vehicle powertrains at mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions

Users interested in obtaining a ready-to-use pre-compiled program and/or results visualization should refer to https://www.carghg.org/

This software is coded entirely in Java; aside from standard Java library, has no dependencies except on the Java implementation of FASTSim (fuel economy simulation tool by NREL). See github.com/khamza075/FASTSim-Java for more details and/or refer to the compile guide in the folder: /documentation/

Source code is available in the folder: /source/pvc/

As of June 2022 (CarGHG 3.1x), only the source code (and basic documentation) is hosted on github. After compiling a runnable .jar file, it needs to be able to read several data files arranged in a certain folder structure. To obtain sample copy of the data files (including sample vehicle models and results), please download the pre-compiled/packaged zip file from https://www.carghg.org/
